# Projectify App UI

## Overview

Projectify is a comprehensive project management system designed to facilitate project tracking, task management, team collaboration, and more. The frontend UI for this application was developed to be user-friendly, responsive, and highly functional. A live demo is available at [projectify.dev](https://projectify.dev).

## Course Highlights

I taught frontend development to 6 students selected from 50 applicants. The focus was on creating a robust and scalable UI for the Projectify app using modern frontend technologies and best practices. Below are the major areas covered in the course:

### Design System

Students learned how to create a complete design system from scratch, which included:

-   **Button**: Customizable buttons for various use cases.
-   **Modals**: Reusable modal components for dialogs and forms.
-   **Selects**: Custom select dropdowns.
-   **Badges**: Status indicators and labels.
-   **Typography**: Consistent and scalable typographic system.
-   **Switch**: Toggle switches for settings.
-   **Tables**: Dynamic and responsive tables for data display.
-   **Checkboxes**: Custom checkbox components.
-   **Inputs**: Styled input fields with validation.
-   **DatePickers**: Date selection components.
-   **Progress Bars**: Visual indicators for progress tracking.

### API Abstraction

-   **Services Layer**: Abstracted API calls into a separate layer called services to manage all HTTP requests, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

### State Management

-   **Context API**: Implemented a Redux-like state management system using Context API, useReducer, and useContext.
-   **Reducer Management**: Explained how to split reducers for modularity and combine them later for state management.

### Routing

-   **Authenticated Routes**: Protected routes to ensure only authenticated users can access certain pages.
-   **Authorized Routes**: Managed access based on user roles and permissions.

### Componentization

-   **Atomic Design Approach**: Taught students how to build components using the atomic design methodology for better reusability and maintainability.

### Styling

-   **Styled Components**: Utilized styled-components for writing CSS-in-JS for components.
-   **TypeScript**: Used TypeScript to ensure type safety and enhance code quality.
-   **Flexbox and CSS Grid**: Taught layout techniques using Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive design.

### Additional Topics

-   **Authentication and Authorization**: Implemented user authentication and role-based authorization.

## Conclusion

The Projectify App UI project provided students with hands-on experience in building a modern, scalable, and maintainable frontend for a project management system. By the end of the course, students had developed a solid understanding of frontend development best practices, advanced state management, and the creation of a robust design system.

The biggest UI project we built is available at [Projectify App UI](https://github.com/aliramazon/projectify-app-ui), and the backend is available at [Projectify App API](https://github.com/aliramazon/projectify-app-api). The live demo of the project can be seen at [projectify.dev](https://projectify.dev).
